# Optimized-Sensor-Placement-using-Genetic-Algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm approach to maximize building coverage using air-quality sensors.

# Overview

This project implements an optimization system that determines the best placement of air-quality sensors inside a 2D building grid. Because each sensor covers only a limited circular area, choosing sensor positions manually is difficult and inefficient.

A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to automatically search for high-quality sensor arrangements that:

Maximize coverage
Minimize cost

This assignment demonstrates how evolutionary algorithms can be used to solve real-world optimization problems.
